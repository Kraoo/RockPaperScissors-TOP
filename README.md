# Rock Paper Scissors Game

This project is part of The Odin Project curriculum. It's a simple implementation of the classic game "Rock Paper Scissors" played against the computer. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and some SASS for my background.

## How to Play

1. Open the pages link.
2. Select your choice of rock, paper, or scissors by clicking on the corresponding button.
3. The computer will randomly select its choice.
4. The winner will be displayed on the screen.

Have fun playing!
